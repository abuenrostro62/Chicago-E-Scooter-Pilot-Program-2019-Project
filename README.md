# Chicago 2019 E-Scooter Share Pilot Program

###### Group Members: Araceli Buenrostro, Julie Mahoney, Michael Kuhn, Stephanie Hidalgo 

The City of Chicago conducted an e-scooter share pilot project from June 15, 2019 to October 15, 2019. The permits for 10 companies were issued by the Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection (BACP). The pilot tested the viability of scooters as a mobility option and was designed to maximize safety and minimize sidewalk clutter.

We analyzed over 700,000 rows of data, more specifically we analyzed trip distances, trip durations, most frequent neighborhoods of E-scooter utilization and compared it to Divvy Bikes, a bike share system in Chicago.
